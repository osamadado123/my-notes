## brief knowledge about developer's mindset

in my opinion having bugs during coding is the most annoying thing because sometimes its really hard to find that bug even though its a simple small bug because  the developer's mindset at that point is so low.

as developers we have to understand what project or software we are working on so we can make a project that actually helps people

and if the developer misunderstands what is the purpose of the project this makes completing the project much harder.

as developers we should make our code as simple as possible cuz complex codes are just a waste of time and effort.

our code should be maintanable because every project faces problems or you need to update things in the code so maintanability is so important.

the hardest thing about solving the porblem is understanding that problem if you can't explain the problem in simple temrs that means you don't actually understand that problem.

sometimes when you have a "good enough" code is fine because a perfect code is almost impossible.

you should try to work on projects that don't exist because working on projects that already exist is a waste of time and effort.

more lines in your code does not mean that your code is better simplicity is the key.

testing in the early stages is better than the late stages because you spend less time money and effort fixing that bug.

rewriting your code is a developer's nightmare and it's not always the answer maybe you can take your time finding the errors and bugs.

commenting on your code should not be about what does that code do because it should be simple to know what does the code do otherwise it needs simplification if its hard to simplify the code you can add comment about the code and what it does.

questions don't always answer you sometimes you need for help from another developer 2 minds are better than 1.
